    <div class="paper-title">The Consequences of Gentrification on Incumbent Residents</div>
    <div class="paper-authors">Mohamed Amine Derdari and Emma Duchini</div>
    <p class="paper-abstract">
      This paper studies the causal effects of gentrification on incumbent residents in England
      over 2001&ndash;2021, using Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) as the unit
      of analysis. I instrument for gentrification&mdash;measured as the increase in
      university-educated residents in initially low-educated neighbourhoods&mdash;using the
      density of pre-2001 listed buildings from Historic England's National Heritage List.
      The analysis harmonises census data to a common 2001 geography to avoid endogeneity
      from boundary changes. Upcoming results will examine the effects on incumbent children's
      education and crime outcomes using the MoJDfE linked dataset, as well as education and
      wage outcomes using the Longitudinal Education Outcomes (LEO) data.

    <div class="paper-title">Understanding Gentrification through Urban Connectivity: A Machine Learning Approach</div>
    <div class="paper-authors">Mohamed Amine Derdari and Alessandro Venerandi</div>
    <p class="paper-abstract">
      This project uses random forest models to explore the relationship between gentrification
      and measures of urban street-network connectivity, including straightness, betweenness,
      and localness. The goal is to uncover which dimensions of neighbourhood connectivity
      are most predictive of gentrification dynamics.
